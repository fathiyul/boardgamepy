# DixiQuote

*A storytelling game about how moments are remembered, not how they happened.*

---

## Overview

**DixiQuote** is a word‑based storytelling game inspired by **Dixit**.

Instead of images, players use **situation cards**—short narrative descriptions of events. One player provides a **poetic, quote‑like clue**, and the others try to match that quote to a situation in a way that is suggestive, but not obvious.

The goal is not to be correct, but to be *interpretable*.

---

## Components

- **Situation Deck**
  - Cards describing situations or events
  - Situations may come from any genre: fantasy, science fiction, myth, history, or everyday life
  - Situation text may be short or long

- **Clue Channel**
  - A single poetic line, quote, or fragment

- **Voting Tokens** (or digital votes)

- **Score Track**

---

## Setup

- 3–8 players
- Shuffle the Situation Deck
- Deal **6 situation cards** to each player
- Choose a starting **Storyteller**

---

## Round Structure

Each round has five phases.

---

### Phase 1 — Choose a Situation

The Storyteller secretly selects **one situation card** from their hand.

---

### Phase 2 — Give a Quote

The Storyteller writes a **quote‑like clue** inspired by the chosen situation.

The clue:
- Must be a single line or sentence fragment
- Should sound like it could appear in a book, film, or poem
- Should express a *way of remembering, framing, or interpreting* the situation

The clue is revealed to all players.

---

### Phase 3 — Submit Situations

All other players select **one situation card** from their hand that they feel best fits the clue.

Selected cards are submitted face‑down.

---

### Phase 4 — Reveal and Vote

All submitted situation cards, including the Storyteller’s card, are shuffled and revealed.

Each non‑Storyteller player votes for **one situation** that they believe best matches the quote.

Players may not vote for their own card.

---

### Phase 5 — Scoring

Scoring rewards ambiguity and penalizes clarity.

#### Situation Cards

- A situation card scores **2 points** if it receives **some but not all** of the votes.
- A situation card scores **1 point** if it receives **zero votes**.
- A situation card scores **0 points** if it receives **all votes**.

#### Storyteller

The Storyteller scores **3 points** if:
- At least **two different situation cards** receive votes
- And **no single card** receives all votes

Otherwise, the Storyteller scores **0 points**.

---

## End of Round

- Each player draws one situation card to return to 6 cards in hand
- The role of Storyteller passes clockwise
- Begin the next round

---

## Invalid Action Penalty

To prevent the game from stalling due to repeated invalid actions:

- Players track consecutive invalid actions during each phase
- After **3 consecutive invalid actions**, the player:
  - Loses **1 point** (minimum score 0)
  - Has their turn automatically skipped for that phase
- The counter resets when a valid action is made or a new phase begins
- If all other players are skipped, the Storyteller automatically receives the 3-point bonus

---

## End of Game

The game ends when **any** of these conditions are met:
- A player reaches the **target score** (default: 20 points)
- The **maximum number of rounds** is reached (default: 15 rounds)
- The Situation Deck runs out

The player with the highest score wins.

---

## Example Round

**Storyteller’s Situation:**
> “The dragon circles once, then leaves without attacking.”

**Quote:**
> “Power does not always need to be proven.”

**Submitted Situations:**
- “The crowd cheers as the wrong name is announced.”
- “The throne remains empty during the celebration.”
- “A sword that has never been drawn is finally removed from its sheath.”

**Votes:**
- Dragon situation → 2 votes
- Throne situation → 1 vote
- Sword situation → 0 votes

**Scoring:**
- Dragon card scores 2 points
- Throne card scores 2 points
- Sword card scores 1 point
- Storyteller scores 3 points

---

## Design Notes

- DixiQuote rewards players who understand how others interpret language
- Overly literal clues tend to collapse voting and score poorly
- The most successful quotes create multiple plausible readings

---

## Optional Variants

- **Genre Round**: All situations must be imagined within a shared genre
- **Blind Quote**: The Storyteller also submits a situation and may vote
- **Long Quote**: Quotes may be up to two lines

---

*DixiQuote is a game about the distance between what happens and how it is remembered.*
